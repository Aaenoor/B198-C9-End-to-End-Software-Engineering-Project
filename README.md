# B198-C9-End-to-End-Software-Engineering-Project
Product Analysis

# Project Overview

This project involves analyzing an electronics dataset from Amazon to gain insights into user behavior, product trends, and overall sales performance. The analysis covers various aspects, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. The dataset is ideal for developing predictive models, understanding customer preferences, and making data-driven marketing decisions.

# Key Features:

Data Exploration: Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset.

Visualization: Generating meaningful charts to identify trends and patterns.

Statistical Insights: Analyzing product ratings, user preferences, and sales timelines.

# Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

Required Libraries

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical computations.

matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.

Install any missing libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Load the Notebook

Save the file ProductAnalysis.ipynb locally or on a cloud storage platform such as Google Drive.

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.

2. Dataset Loading

The dataset used is a CSV file (electronics.csv) containing information about electronics sales on Amazon.

Ensure the dataset is located in the same directory as the notebook or update the file path accordingly.

Example Code:

# Importing the dataset

dataset = pd.read_csv('electronics.csv')

# Displaying the first five rows
dataset.head()

3. Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Replacing or removing null entries.

Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features such as year or category.

Data Formatting: Standardizing column names and types.

Example Code:

# Check for missing values
dataset.isnull().sum()

# Drop rows with missing values
dataset.dropna(inplace=True)

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook provides detailed visualizations to explore:

Distribution of product ratings.

Most popular product categories.

Seasonal trends in sales.

Example Code:

# Visualizing the distribution of ratings
sns.histplot(dataset['rating'], bins=10, kde=True)
plt.title('Rating Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Rating')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Analyzing top categories
sns.countplot(data=dataset, y='category', order=dataset['category'].value_counts().index[:10])
plt.title('Top 10 Product Categories')
plt.show()

5. Visualization Outputs

The notebook generates the following visualizations:

Bar Plots: For analyzing category-wise sales.

Histograms: For exploring user rating distributions.

Time-Series Plots: For identifying trends over time.

6. Running the Notebook

Run each cell sequentially (Shift + Enter) in your Python environment.

Ensure the dataset is correctly loaded, and all required libraries are installed.

Outputs and Insights

# Key Findings:

Top Categories: Portable Audio & Video items dominated sales.

User Ratings: Majority of products received ratings between 3 and 5.

Sales Trends: Seasonal spikes indicate higher sales during specific periods, such as holidays.

# Recommendations:

Focus marketing efforts on the most popular categories.

Enhance product quality to improve ratings below 3.

Plan promotions during peak sales periods to maximize revenue.
